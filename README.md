# DGA Botnet Detection with LSTM-based AI Model

## Overview

This repository hosts the code and resources for an artificial intelligence model built on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, dedicated to the detection of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Botnets. DGA Botnets are a significant cybersecurity threat, and this model aims to identify malicious domains generated by such botnets with a high accuracy rate.

## Model Architecture

The core of the detection system is an LSTM-based neural network. LSTM networks excel in capturing temporal patterns, making them well-suited for the dynamic and evolving nature of DGA-generated domain names.

## Key Features

- **Adaptability:** The model is designed to handle large and diverse datasets, ensuring its adaptability to various cyber threat landscapes.


## Results

The model has been rigorously tested on diverse datasets, achieving an accuracy rate of 98.2%. Detailed performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, are available in the results section.
